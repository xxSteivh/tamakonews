        <h2>'So close it's painful:' NBA insiders pick sides in SGA-Jokić MVP race that feels '50-50' despite current odds</h2>
        <img src="sports2.png" alt="NBA MVP Race: SGA vs Jokić">
        <p>They'll tell you the NBA's Most Valuable Player Award has been decided. They'll tell you Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the prodigious and remarkable engine behind the Oklahoma City Thunder, is a shoo-in. They'll tell you SGA's literal odds, a rising voter fatigue, the force of narrative and the power of his team's winning ways has set this thing in stone.</p>
        <p>But a survey of likely voters and conversation with those across the NBA -- former players, all-time greats, GMs, scouts -- delivered a fascinating reality: This race between SGA and Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokić is wide open, and those of us that get to choose will have an excruciating decision to make in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>Several media members and NBA bigwigs were flummoxed when pressed to choose, if the vote were today, between the two players.</p>
        <p>Don't misunderstand. There is not a trace of disrespect or doubt about SGA's stunning season and rock-solid MVP résumé. He's a superstar, whose league-leading 33 points per game, defensive excellence, exceptional leadership and status as the centerpiece of an OKC team running away with the West make him a wholly worthy favorite.</p>
        <p>Vegas certainly thinks so. Sportsbooks have him at a whopping -850 to win MVP. The general narrative out there -- and those can take on lives of their own -- also unrelentingly pushes the notion that the hardware will surely, undoubtedly, irrevocably go Shai's way.</p>
        <h3>A Current NBA GM</h3>
        <p>"For me, I probably tend to lean into winning. And your impact on winning. And so to me both are MVP candidates, both have had an MVP season, and it's not to say one is an MVP and one is not. But if I had an actual vote I would give it to Shai, because they have won at a much higher level. And winning at that level matters, and I'm going to give an edge to the winning. And that, to me, has Shai as the MVP."</p>
        <p>And on and on it goes. SGA just over Jokić. No, Jokić just over SGA. Or maybe the other way around? Who can know? It's so close.</p>
        <p>One thing, and maybe only one thing about this MVP race, is clear: The closing few weeks will be critical in a contest between two remarkable players having remarkable seasons in which every twist, turn, and eye-popping performance could end up making the difference.</p>
