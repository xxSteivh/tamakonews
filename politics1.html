        <h2>SolGen Guevarra still enjoys trust, confidence of Marcos - Palace</h2>
        <img src="politics1.png" alt="politics1">
        <p>MANILA (UPDATED) — Malacanang on Thursday said Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra still enjoys the trust and confidence of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. despite his decision to recuse his office from defending the government in petitions questioning former president Rodrigo Duterte's arrest before the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>In a Palace briefing, Malacañang Press Officer Claire Castro said Guevarra continues to enjoy the trust of Marcos Jr.</p>
        <p>“Noong tinanong ko po siya kung magre-resign po si SolGen, ang sabi niya, 'Hindi ko hinihingi ang pagre-resign niya'. So, iyon lang po ang sinabi niya. So, nandoon pa rin po iyong trust niya kay SolGen Menardo Guevarra,” she said.</p>
        <p>(When I asked him if the solicitor general will resign, he said: 'I am not asking for his resignation.' So, that is all he said. So, SolGen Menardo Guevarra still has the President's trust)</p>
        <p>Castro earlier called on Guevarra to assess whether he is still fit to serve as solicitor general following his decision to stay out of Supreme Court petitions questioning Duterte's arrest and transfer to the International Criminal Court.</p>
        <p>The OSG and the government have taken the position that the ICC does not have jurisdiction in the Philippines but a Supreme Court decision affirming the Philippines' withdrawal from the court also states the country is bound to cooperate on alleged incidents that happened before withdrawal.</p>
        <p>Castro earlier said Guevarra should assess whether he still deserves to stand as solicitor general, the mandated legal defender of the government.</p>
