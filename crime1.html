        <h2>Woman Who Killed Cousin with Autism After Torturing Him for 32 Days During 'Bootcamp' Learns Fate</h2>
        <img src="crime1.png" alt="Crime Scene Image" />

        <p>A New York City woman has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for the 2021 killing of her teenage cousin with intellectual disabilities, whom she tortured for more than a month.</p>

        <p>The victim, 15-year-old Jallen McConnie, died from “homicidal asphyxia” after being severely beaten on June 28, 2021, in his cousin Johnette Booker’s Manhattan home, according to a March 24 press statement from the Manhattan District Attorney’s office.</p>

        <p>Booker, 43, was convicted on several charges, including manslaughter, in February, District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at the time.</p>

        <p>She has now been sentenced to 20 years in prison, Bragg said in the release.</p>

        <p>At trial, prosecutors said Booker had repeatedly attacked Jallen, who had been sent to her for a “cousin boot camp” by a relative for disciplinary reasons, per the statement.</p>

        <p>During his stay in Booker's home, Booker “repeatedly physically and emotionally tortured” the child, who had autism, Bragg said in his statement.</p>

        <p>The torture included beating him with belts; forcing him to sleep on the floor; intensive exercises; standing in a corner and touching his toes; and denying him his prescribed medication, per Bragg.</p>

        <p>On the day of the killing, Booker beat Jallen for over an hour, using a belt and hitting him across his face, arms, legs, and body, Bragg said. The child was left with welts and bruises all over his body.</p>

        <p>Prosecutors said two other people joined Booker during the attack. After beating him, the group dragged Jallen to the bathroom and one of them forced water down Jallen’s throat, and Booker aided in that attack. It's not immediately clear if the two other people allegedly involved in the attack face charges.</p>

        <p>The child collapsed in the bathtub.</p>

        <p>Booker also failed to call emergency services or family members in the immediate aftermath of the incident, Bragg said. She later gave officers several inconsistent statements, such as claiming she was not at home when the attack happened.</p>

        <p>She initially also claimed Jallen had been “jumped” by “boys in the park,” later changing the story to say Jallen died by suicide, according to Bragg.</p>

        <p>A GoFundMe has been set up for Jallen to assist his family with a headstone and memorial services.</p>
