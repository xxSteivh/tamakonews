        <h2>Respect rights in ‘fake news’ fight, gov’t urged.</h2>

        <p>MANILA, Philippines — Growing concerns over the proliferation of fake news after the March 11 arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte have also prompted calls to ensure the protection of constitutional rights in the monitoring of public remarks, protest actions, and particularly online content.</p>

        <p>Both the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) and the leader of the Senate on Monday warned against prior restraint, or restrictions by the government on free speech and expression that essentially serve as censorship.</p>

        <p>Responding to the reported arrest of an online content creator who allegedly posted fake content against President Marcos, the CHR reminded law enforcers to “remain circumspect in enforcing criminal laws that have a direct impact on the enjoyment of the freedom of expression by every individual.”</p>

        <p>“While there are limitations to freedom of expression, government-based sanctions that look into the truth or falsity of a statement are a form of content-based restraint that may be considered a prior restraint on free speech prohibited by Article III, Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution,” the commission said in a statement.</p>

        <p>The said provision in the Bill of Rights (Article III of the Constitution) states that, “No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.”</p>

        <h2>Arrest, inquiry</h2>
        <p>On March 20, the National Bureau of Investigation arrested 30-year-old content creator Wendelyn Magalso of Oslob, Cebu. According to the bureau, Magalso had attributed to Mr. Marcos a fake statement calling for the legalization of illegal drugs.</p>

        <p>The arrest was hailed by some lawmakers, such as House Assistant Majority Leader Amparo Maria Zamora, who pointed out that “there are limits to being a ‘content creator,’ especially if you do it to slander, spread lies and profit from fraud.”</p>

        <p>A content creator like Magalso is defined as someone who creates and produces entertaining or educational digital content, especially on social media channels, whereas a vlogger is a type of content creator who creates “vlogs” or video blogs that may focus on specific niches.</p>

        <p>Other types of online and social media personalities are influencers, who utilize their online reach and appeal to influence people to take on specific actions via their social media accounts, and bloggers who create written content based on more niche communities or subjects.</p>

        <p>Following Magalso’s arrest, a tripartite committee of the House of Representatives continued its inquiry into the dissemination of fake news, attended this time by online personalities it had earlier summoned.</p>

        <p>Three of them were forced to apologize after admitting to making false or baseless claims.</p>

        <p>But Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr., chair of the human rights panel in the committee, said on Monday that “These apologies… are not enough. If these vloggers are truly sincere, they must stop spreading lies and start presenting the truth —not their so-called ‘truth,’ but the real, honest-to-God truth.”</p>
