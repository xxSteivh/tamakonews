        <h2>PBA Finals: TNT makes most out of Brownlee exit to survive Ginebra</h2>
        <img src="sports1.png" alt="PBA Finals: TNT vs Ginebra" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <p>It looks like the big shoes left by Jayson Castro fit Rey Nambatac just fine.</p>
        <p>Nambatac showed that he’s thriving in the responsibility after helping TNT take a 2-1 lead in its PBA Commissioner’s Cup title series with Barangay Ginebra with an 87-85 win that left the Gin Kings down and in a worrying situation concerning Justin Brownlee’s condition.</p>
        <p>“I can feel [Castro’s] presence,” Nambatac said after the Tropang Giga’s hard-fought triumph Wednesday at PhilSports Arena in Pasig City, which was practically clinched by his three-point shot in the dying seconds.</p>
        <p>Nambatac’s corner trey off three offensive rebounds, including two by Calvin Oftana, broke an 82-all tie with 30 seconds to go to cap off a playoff-high 24 points that validated the reason why TNT took him in a trade during the offseason.</p>
        <p>The southpaw guard had been on an impressive showing manning the point in the series, giving the Tropang Giga some needed punch after Castro was ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury during the semifinals.</p>
        <p>“Rey had big boy pants,” said import Rondae Hollis-Jefferson of Nambatac. Hollis-Jefferson had 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists while Oftana put up 16 points, five rebounds and four assists as TNT moved two wins shy of winning another title at the expense of Ginebra.</p>
        <p>But regaining control of the series didn’t come easy for the Tropang Giga, who had to weather the determined Gin Kings, who pushed through despite losing Brownlee in the third quarter with a dislocated right thumb.</p>
        <p>Brownlee stayed for a few minutes in the locker room before being taken to the hospital.</p>
        <p>“Malas [tough break],” said a Ginebra official, lamenting on Brownlee’s predicament after checking on the resident import.</p>
        <p>Ginebra did take the lead for a few moments in the fourth despite being handicapped, but Nambatac and TNT refused to back down.</p>
        <p>“I told the players that this is going to be the best Ginebra team here even without Justin. So we have to be at our best,” said coach Chot Reyes.</p>
        <p>Nambatac also had five rebounds and seven assists as he was not just about scoring during a tense game that saw better offense compared to the low-scoring Game 2 that ended with Ginebra notching a thrilling 71-70 win.</p>
        <p>TNT also played with poise, as even Poy Erram embraced the “iyakin (cry baby)” chants of Ginebra fans to produce five points and three rebounds.</p>
        <p>Game 4 is set Friday March 21, 2025 at Ynares Center in Antipolo, and Ginebra is obviously hoping for the best results on Brownlee’s injury.</p>
